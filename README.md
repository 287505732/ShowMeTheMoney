# Show Me The Money

Description: The price of a stock relies on a vast amount of data. During boilermake, a hackathon at purdue, we developed an application
that web scrapes hundreds of news articles relevant to a company and projects a sentiment analysis tool onto the data to engineer a 
new dimension to stock analysis. Very few tools out there do what this application does, and the ones that do exist lack foundamental 
features that an investment banking analyst would be interested in.
