# Show Me The Money

Description: The price of a stock relies on a vast amount of data. During boilermake, a hackathon at purdue, we developed an application
that web scrapes hundreds of news articles relevant to a company and projects a sentiment analysis tool onto the data to engineer a 
new dimension to stock analysis. Very few tools out there do what this application does, and the ones that do exist lack foundamental 
features that an investment banking analyst would be interested in. 

## Project Setup

_How do I, as a developer, start working on the project?_ 
Requirements: requires Bloomberg open API subscription
              nodejs 


_Instructions_ 
1. npm install express
2. npm install request
3. npm install feed-read
4. npm install blbai
5. 


## Why isn't this project hosted online?

    We do not have the money to maintain the Bloomberg open API subscription. 

## What's the future?
    We see this as an ongoing project and hope to continue engineering new tools to this application. We believe that implementing
    concurrency is very important going onwards.
